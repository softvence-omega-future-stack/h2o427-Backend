### Admin Sends Notification to User:
```python
from notifications.signals import send_user_notification

send_user_notification(
    recipient_user=user,
    title='Account Verified',
    message='Your account has been verified successfully.',
    category=Notification.GENERAL,
    sender=admin_user
)
```

### Admin Sends Bulk Notification:
```python
# Via API
POST /api/notifications/bulk-create/
{
  "recipient_ids": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
  "type": "admin_to_user",
  "category": "general",
  "title": "System Maintenance",
  "message": "Scheduled maintenance on Sunday"
}
```

### User Sends Help Request:
```python
# Via API
POST /api/notifications/
{
  "recipient": admin_id,
  "type": "user_to_admin",
  "category": "general",
  "title": "Help Request",
  "message": "Need assistance with subscription"
}
```
