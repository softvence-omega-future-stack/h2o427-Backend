# ✅ Simplified Password Reset Flow

## Overview
The password reset flow has been simplified! Users now get a direct link in their email that takes them to a beautiful password reset page - **no frontend coding required!**

---

## 🔄 How It Works

### **Step 1: User Requests Password Reset**
```bash
POST /api/auth/forgot-password/
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "user@example.com"
}
```

### **Step 2: User Receives Email**
Email contains a link like:
```
https://h2o427-backend-u9bx.onrender.com/reset-password/NDk/cy83ft-0ef9e8a23abb153c18b247d0bc4de37c/
```

### **Step 3: User Clicks Link**
- Browser opens the reset link
- Backend **automatically verifies the token**
- Shows a beautiful HTML password reset form
- If token is invalid/expired, shows error message

### **Step 4: User Sets New Password**
- User enters new password (twice for confirmation)
- Clicks "Reset Password" button
- Backend processes it and shows success message
- User clicks "Back to Login" and logs in with new password
